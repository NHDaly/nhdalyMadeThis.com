I make games under the game developer company _nhdalyMadeThis, LLC_.

## Paddle Battle ![icon]({{ "assets/images/Paddle-Battle-Icon.png" }}){:width="50px"}
My first product is a simple game written entirely in [Julia{% include icon-julia-logo-three-balls.html %}](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), intended as an example of creating and publishing a game from scratch with Julia. The code for the project is available here under the MIT license:<br>
[https://github.com/NHDaly/PaddleBattleJL](https://github.com/NHDaly/PaddleBattleJL)

I would love you to fork it and change it and sell what you create!

*Download the game here: [Paddle-Battle.dmg](https://github.com/NHDaly/PaddleBattleJL/releases/download/v1.0.2/Paddle-Battle.dmg)*
